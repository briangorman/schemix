Release              Comments/changes

0.1.0 = "2.4.20"     First release of Schemix.

0.2.0                Schemix has a concept of kernel name-spaces
                     (symbols of the form module-name::symbol-name),
                     and it builds as a module, or as part of the kernel,
                     on Linux versions 2.4.x and 2.5.x.
                     It can optionally use kallsyms and/or devfs.
                     It understands all primitive C types, and also
                     supports multidimensional arrays of C types in
                     a way that is compatable with SRFI 25.
                     For each independent Scheme interpreter, you can
                     enable and disable debug messages at run-time.
                     There is a 'help' function for getting help on
                     built-in procedures.

0.3.0                Schemix understands all of the kernel structures,
                     and can define new types of structure, and can
                     emit C code to define the new structures so that
                     new modules written in C can use them.

0.4.0                Schemix can make calls to all kernel functions.

0.5.0                Schemix can re-implement one of the hardware drivers.

0.6.0                Schemix can re-implement most things in /proc.

0.7.0                Schemix can insert hooks into kernel functions.

0.8.0                Support is added for floating-point, rational
                     and complex numbers and bignums.

0.9.0                Schemix is R5RS compliant.

1.0.0                Lots of testing - first stable release.

1.1.0                The "define" special form tries to avoid boxing
                     and unboxing kernel values whenever it can,
                     e.g. when there are expressions of the form
                     (set! kernel::a (+ kernel::b kernel::c)).

1.2.0                The "define" special form compiles some Scheme
                     code to native machine code for faster execution.
