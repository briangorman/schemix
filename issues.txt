                This is issues.txt for Schemix-2.4.20
                =====================================

- The *on-seek* hook is not implemented yet.

- If you put a (display ...) in *on-read*, it will loop infinitely.
  Each time the user reads something from the device, something
  more gets displayed and so there is more to read.  This is not
  actually a bug!
  What you should do, if you want *on-read* to display something
  but you don't want a loop, is to make *on-read* display only
  every other time it is called.

- The assert-type procedure knows all primitive C types, but
  not structures yet.

- The special form kernel-lambda recognises int and char*.  It will
  recognise any combination of the two types, up to a maximum of
  three arguments.  It does, however, assume that all arguments are
  passed on the stack (asmlinkage) which isn't always the case.

- When you make a kernel function available to Schemix using the
  kernel-lambda special form, there is no way to see its return value.

- The kernel-lambda special form uses a void* to represent the address
  of the C function that it captures.  Apparently this is not portable
  and so will have to be addressed before Schemix will work on
  architectures other than x86.

- I do not know how far, and in what ways, Schemix differs from R5RS.
